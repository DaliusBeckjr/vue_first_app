# Counter (Vue.js)
###

Build a Vue application that counts the number of a value that is clicked

requirement:
- create a button that counts the value up

- create a button that decreases the value

### some helpful tips:
We can increment the value if it doesn't exist in the app

```
// basic vue app structure
const app = Vue.createApp({

    data() {
        return {
            //values go inside this array
        }
    }
})

app.mount('') // where constant is being stored from html 
```
